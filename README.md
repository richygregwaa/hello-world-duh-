# hello-world-duh-
First repository named hello world as tradition

Haven't decided what to use this repository for yet. Will probably set up an adequately named one once I've got myself orientated with github. Hopefully store some Python files and possibly include RobotFramework files. At the moment I've got all Python scripts on my personal laptop. It would be useful to access them from anywhere and GitHub is ideal as opposed to storing my files on dropbox or google drive etc. I'm not even doing that at the mo!
